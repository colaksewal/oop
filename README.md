## HOW TO RUN
### 1. Our code is running in QT. We downloaded Qt6 6.6.1 for this. (Some features may not work as intended when running on a version below this version)
### 2. We download the latest version of the project codes from the Github repository to our computer. 
### 3. On the opening screen of Qt, we press the 'Open Project' button, select the code file we downloaded and open it.
### 4. After our codes are opened in the Qt window, we start our game by pressing the 'Run' button.
### 5. In our game, the player moves with the arrow keys of the keyboard and sends bullets to the enemies with the space key.
